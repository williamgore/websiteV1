                Programming History

            <p>
                I started out making simple games in Scratch in middle school. 
                It wasn’t until the ninth grade that my brother taught me some basic java and I 
                started making a little text based ‘Zork’ style game. 
                In the tenth grade I started taking Computer Science in school and finished out 
                highschool with IB Computer Science in the twelfth grade. Shortly after i started 
                university during the covid times and my first year was a flop to say the least. 
                After this I took a year doing part time classes and changed my plan from being a 
                biochem major to being a computer science major. Since then my grades have been on 
                a steady incline and I’ve been working very hard towards my degree. 
                Throughout my years I’ve gained experience in C#, Java, Processing, Python, R, C, 
                HTML, CSS, and some C++.
