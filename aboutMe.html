                Programming History
            </h2>
            <p>
                My first introduction to programming was learning to make simple games in Scratch. 
                It wasn’t until the ninth grade when my older brother taught me some basic java, which I used to
                make a little text based game inspired by ‘Zork’. 
                In the tenth grade, I started taking Computer Science courses and graduated high school having 
                completed IB Computer Science in 2020. Shortly after, I started  
                university. The transition from high school to university during the
                pandemic, with everything online, was very challenging. I learned a lot in my first year, about
                how to deal with stress, isolation and failure.
                After this, I took a year doing part time classes, and changed my plan from being a 
                biochem major to being a computer science major. Since then, my grades have been on 
                a steady incline and I’ve been working hard towards my degree. 
                Throughout all of this, I’ve gained experience in C#, Java, Processing, Python, R, C, 
                HTML, CSS, and some C++. I am motivated and excited to push myself further, take on new projects,
                and learn the skills to become a better programmer.
