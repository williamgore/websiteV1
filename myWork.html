                Python Weather Data Project
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                This was a small project I’ve worked on here and there for the month of August. Every winter I’m eager for the snow to melt and this simple program can tell me if it’s warmer or colder than previous years.
    
                This was the first time I’ve written anything in python and with that, came challenges. The biggest hurdle to overcome was the difference in writing my code when using an interpreter vs a compiler.

            <p>
                    This website has gone through a few iterations, as seen on my github. The main purpose of making my
                website was to gain some basic experience in CSS and HTML, and so far I feel that I have made good
                progress. The biggest challenge with this project was learning how CSS works and getting things to
                work just the way I wanted them to. Specifically on the first version of my website, available to
                see on my github, when trying to get the body boxes to change size and position with a scaling page.
